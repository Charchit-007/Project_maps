made new route for sending the blockage data to the maps page
    and it will be fetched using fetchBlockages() function
    it will return the data as - 
    {
    "blockages": {
        "active_blockages": [
        {
            "Borough": "Manhattan",
            "From Date": "4/26/25",
            "From Street": "West 40th Street",
            "Reason": "Unknown",
            "Time": "01 am to 2 pm",
            "To Date": "Sat, 26 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT",
            "To Street": "Broadway",
            "month": 4.0
        },
        ],
        "com_reason": {
        "DDC reconstruction project, utility installation.": 1,
        "Unknown": 1,
        "alternate configuration all phases of construction for pumping concrete.": 4,
        "use of concrete pumps, boom trucks, and knuckle booms.": 2,
        "use of knuckle boom for sign work.": 1
        },
        "total_blockages": 8
    },
    "street_name": "Broadway"
    }

when loadRoute is called in Maps page
    fetchBlockages() will run twice - for Origin and destination
    so we will add both point's blockage(active_blockages) data in a List - blockageResult

    then, we call _generateBlockageMarkers()
        it will run a for loop for each blockage in the blockageResult list

        --------------
        it will fetch from street's and to street's coordinates from GeocodeMaps API (https://geocode.maps.co/)
        fetchStreetCoordinates()
        will take street name and boro(for city parameter in API URI) as parameter
        eg -https://geocode.maps.co/search?street=West%2040th%20Street&city=Manhattan&state=NY&country=US&api_key=67f0baebcd569677095236hjyea6002&limit=1
        [
                        {
                            "place_id": 319628560,
                            "licence": "Data Â© OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL 1.0. https://osm.org/copyright",
                            "osm_type": "way",
                            "osm_id": 696491643,
                            "boundingbox": [
                            "40.7595545",
                            "40.759677",
                            "-73.9995946",
                            "-73.9992994"
                            ],
                            "lat": "40.759595",
                            "lon": "-73.9993989",
                            "display_name": "West 40th Street, Clinton, Manhattan Community Board 4, Manhattan, New York County, New York, 10018, United States",
                            "class": "highway",
                            "type": "primary",
                            "importance": 0.51001
                        }
        ]

        then, we take the middle point of those coords (as blockage is between two streets, we can plot the middle point of them as the blockage point)
        then, we check if that middle point lies Near our route points (same as accident markers)
        if they do, we add that mid point to _blockageMarkers list

        finally, add _blockageMarkers to the stack Marker layer to plot them

        all this happens for each blockage in the blockageResult list

issues - 
    kuch blockages nahi aayenge as API limit is 1 request per second
        so, only some are request get 200 status code
    We are taking midpoint of the blockage from and to points and then checking if it lies within 200 meters of any routePoint
        so, thoda accuracy issue hai.
